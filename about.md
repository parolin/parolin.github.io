That is my personal blog where I can write and post about my ideas and to share the knowledge that I gained over time about Network and Security.

The name show cdp neighbors came from the Cisco command with same name, used to display information about neighboring devices discovered using CDP Protocol

I read many blogs and articles that lot of engineers/authors/hackers wrote and it helped me a lot to learn new things and understand important fundamentals, and that is a way to give back and allow, like a CDP protocol, the exchange of information, the discovering of new peers, information and challenges.

I hope you enjoy.
